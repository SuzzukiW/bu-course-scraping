By applying a knowledge of contemporary and historical practices, gained from readings, pre-practicum experiences, and discussions of theories and trends in teaching art, pre-service teachers develop their own philosophies and approaches. Course participants examine and content to the 5-12 state and national art standards and explore frameworks for integrating arts education with other content areas. A variety of media and concepts are introduced and explored and the participants engage in arts-based research, using their insights to design learning experiences that enhance critical and creative development. As a culmination, the students develop unit and lesson plans. Taken in the final year before a student's practicum experiences, students concurrently enroll in the 1-credit CFA AR 662: Secondary Pre-practicum.

        "description": "The \"Art Leaders Forum\" is a collective enterprise of critical inquiry, reflection and open discussion about what it means to lead as an artist now. The implications of assuming leadership are vast----vision, exertion, generosity, intelligence, precision, responsibility, compassion ... Furthermore, to lead cannot mean to ignore the complex reality we live in as a society: Inequity, social disparities, structural racism and discrimination are not undesired mistakes, but structural aspects of the world we live in. In other words, the way our society defines what is \"leadership\" and \"who should lead\" has the power to perpetuate, or for the same matter, dismantle these issues. Our collective inquiry and discussion will inevitably deal with this pressing reality. A group of global art leaders, activists and entrepreneurs from across the globe will join the forum to illustrate, enrich and guide this discussion. The \"Art Leaders Forum\" is a co-creation process in need of every voice and every view that engages in it. Tourism is not an option here: taking part in the forum clearly demands something of each of us----to fully listen and to dare to be heard; to be seen and to see others and their reality. To support and enhance such demanding work the course will introduce notions of mindfulness, entrepreneurship, active listening, embodiment and non-violent communication, at the time that will study and explore different models of leadership, activism, community and social impact in the arts."

Through these musical practices, we will investigate the ways in which many of these styles are the product of long running intra/intercultural dialogues, struggles, and negotiation processes that continue to produce new hybrid forms. Because of the vast array of people and cultures within each selected area, this course is necessarily selective and introductory. A variety of scholars and performing artists will be invited to give a workshop on music/dance and discuss their lives as musicians. Over the course of the semester, you will gain an understanding of the myriad ways people use music to construct and individual group identities, the diverse ways groups incorporate music into their lives, and how to understand music within a broader historical, political, and economic context. You will also be introduced to basic musical concepts and terminology, and acquire listening skills that will enable you to better encounter and understand music in this course and beyond.
