Through data modeling and visualization, students will construct and communicate arguments that are rooted in data. The course expects only basic computer knowledge and teaches concepts and skills in computer programming (Python), linear regression, and statistical inference. The course delves into dilemmas surrounding data analysis, such as balancing individual privacy and social utility, and prepares students for the data driven world all around us. Students with interests from politics to sports, finance to journalism, entrepreneurship to smart cities, etc., can use the knowledge of data science they gain in this class to enhance those interests.

Biological research is rarely unequivocal in its findings; students will learn to systematically identify the claims advanced in research papers and evaluate whether each claim is established beyond a reasonable doubt by supporting evidence. We will examine papers that both meet and fail this test. In today's biology, to properly examine a paper in this way it is increasingly important to engage with the data provided as supporting evidence, and to critically examine the computational approach. Students will work with published data and computational tools. Further, students will learn to identify the ideology implicit in each paper, to understand how ideology shapes both the research questions and approach, and to imagine the same research under an alternative mindset. Classes will be split into lectures on background material for each paper and group discussions. Students will work in small groups to write a report on each paper. Each student will work on a final project to produce a critical review of a broader topic in the field.

In many cases, it is no longer possible to design feasible algorithms that can freely access the entire data set. Instead of that we often have to resort to techniques that allow for reducing the amount of data such as sampling, sketching, dimensionality reduction, and core sets. Apart from these approaches, the course will also explore scenarios in which large data sets are distributed across several machines or even geographical locations and the goal is to design efficient communication protocols or MapReduce algorithms.
