Whether knowing what is being asked of you as a clinician, or being placed in a leadership position, many health and rehabilitation professionals will assume the role of a manager or have leadership responsibilities during the course of their career, often sooner than expected. The increasing rate of change in the healthcare environment is a major factor in this emphasis on leadership. This can take many forms, and an emphasis will be placed on how one can assume a position of leading in different avenues. This course will help foster the growth of an individual's knowledge and capacity to lead, in whatever form it takes. This course also develops and enhances the students' understanding of the health care system, the social and economic forces affecting the health care system, and its ability to function effectively. Additionally, the course will prepare students to enter the workforce by introducing them to a variety of tools and experiences that will enable them to manage organizations, programs, resources, and people more effectively.

They can cause significant disability, chronic illness, and death in both children and adults. The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of each of the NTDs including transmission, disease progression, treatment, epidemiology, and control strategies. In addition, we will examine their public health importance and the effects they have at the individual, community, and national level. We will also discuss societal contexts and ethics around treatment, research, advocacy, and prevention."

It takes skill combining these sources of evidence into effective and efficient physical practice. This course enhances the student's ability to formulate answerable clinical questions, search relevant research literature, analyze the validity of the outcomes reported in these studies, and combine the outcomes of different research studies in the form of a research synthesis (i.e., critical review and meta-analysis).
