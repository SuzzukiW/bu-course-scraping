We cover the analysis of reasoning with truth-functions (\"and\", \"or\", \"not\", \"if ... then\") and with quantifiers (\"all\", \"some\"), attending to formal languages and axiomatic systems for logical deduction. Throughout, we aim to clearly and systematically display both the theory underlying the norms of valid reasoning and their applications to particular problems of argumentation.
