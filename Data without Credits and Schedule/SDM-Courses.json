The experience is meant to introduce the student to the practice of medicine (broadly defined) and allows the student to practice targeted parts of the medical interview and physical exam. The hands-on learning that these sessions provide is a complement to the basic science courses and physical examination skills obtained in Dental school. A critical component of this education exercise should be on observation of the medical interview in action and observing aspects of the patient-doctor relationship. Limited skills such as interviewing for an HPI, taking a family history, checking vital signs, and holding an otoscope will also be covered. Topics range from how to take vital signs to enhancing awareness of cross-cultural issues. The mentor will need to help the student complete the assignment by arranging for the student to spend a little extra time with a patient each week or two. In some cases the mentor will choose to discuss with the student how s/he approaches a certain topic (for example, how to screen for domestic violence in the pediatric setting."

Time will be spent demonstrating how to effectively analyze information collected in the comprehensive oral evaluation in light of best practices, patients desires and understanding and other modifying factors. The students learn skills that enable them to evaluate a patient's needs and develop an orderly, prioritized and sequential course of treatment that is problem- based. They will be able to develop a recommended plan as well as an alternative plan of therapy and support their decisions based on the available evidence in the dental literature. Utilizing treatment plans presented during students' clinical work, the student learns to present this information in a way that enables the patient to conceptualize what treatment and to co-participate in an informed fashion in the development of their treatment plan.
