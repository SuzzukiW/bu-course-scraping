Because criminology is interdisciplinary, students will examine theories that are grounded in a range of academic perspectives, including sociological, biological, political, psychological and economic explanations for crime. These theories will be centered on important public policy debates about a host of contemporary problems, including: firearm violence, high post- incarceration recidivism, opioid use disorder crisis and human trafficking. Course lectures and discussions focus on the historical development of the theories, their major assumptions and propositions, their relevance for public policy and practice. As the course progresses through each explanation for crime, students will have the opportunity to critically evaluate the validity of different explanations for crime as well as criminal justice policies and practices that they support."

This course will focus on communications strategy -- where it's been, where it's going with a focus on executing strategies through social media platforms that align with overall business (brand) goals and objectives. To help gain this perspective, students will learn from various experts (guests to class) and hands-on exercises designed to give all students a solid baseline for the dominant and tertiary social media platforms. I fully believe that the best way to learn and understand social media is to jump in and engage with the different platforms. This class will encourage and insist that you engage with at least two social media platforms so you can bring this first-hand knowledge to class."

This course applies the principles from CS 535 to understand the engineering that lead to them as well as the special problems that confront network technologies that operate directly over the physical media. These Media specific layers have three problems to solve: the usual one of multiple users of a common resource, accommodating the particular characteristics of the media, and providing (to the degree possible) a media- independent service to the layers above. While CS 535 provides a high-level view of some of these technologies, in this course, they are considered in much greater detail as to how these technologies address their requirements and take advantage of the assumptions made. The emphasis is on those technologies that are either representative of a type or take a unique perspective on the problem. Hence, the traditional data link protocols, such as HDLC, modern Ethernet (primarily VLANs), WiFi (802.11) represent the first type, while media technologies, such as DOCSIS, RFIDs, IoT, and cellular mobile networks are representative of the second.

In this English 201 course, we'll engage with the profound philosophical insights from Heraclitus, the wisdom of indigenous Nations, and study the works of 19th and 20th Century writers like William Wordsworth, E.M. Forster, and Joy Harjo to tackle the modern dichotomy between rational and intuitive thought which has become particularly relevant in the age of AI. We will put special attention on the process of thinking and writing and deploy practical methods for empowering the writing process through critically and imaginatively engaging the intricate relationship between the mind, nature, technological artifacts and the tools of composition.

We will also locate the historical and cultural contexts of these works. Some of these novels were widely read at the time they were published; other works had a more limited distribution, but subsequently have been recognized as valuable contributions to the American literary tradition. We will consider art forms in their larger cultural context and consider what \"cultural work\" any artistic expression does. How does literature convey the values and attitudes of the people who produce it? And conversely, how does literature influence the values and attitudes of the people who read it?"

Beyond the utter chaos that follows, one thing stands out: we would starve. US-based Latin American or Spanish-speaking peoples, today grouped under the term LatinX, are a fundamental force in the US food system. This course explores the US food system through the lens of LatinX experiences. We start from an understanding of the history of people and mobility in the Americas, then focus on examples of food production and consumption. Case studies will range from Central American laborers in Vermont dairy farms, churro stand operators in the NYC subway, and digital nomads in trendy neighborhoods of Mexico City. Students will prepare final projects that support their understanding of their own role in this food system. If your interests gravitate around American history, immigration, (inter)national security, supply chains, food economics, labor rights, food marketing, specialty agriculture or commodity production, and social justice, this course will aid you in researching multidisciplinary responses to questions such as: \"From whose farm to whose table?\""

We will study the senses as physical and cultural phenomena, the evolving concepts of terroir and craft, human nutritional and behavioral science, sensory perception and function, and the sensory and scientific aspects of food preparation and consumption. Understanding these processes, constructions and theories is key to understanding a vast array of food-related topics; cheese-making, wine-tasting, fermentation, food preservation, culinary tools and methods, cravings and food avoidance, sustainability and terroir, to name just a few."

        "description": "Taste has an undeniable personal immediacy: producing visceral feelings ranging from delight to disgust. As a result, in our everyday lives we tend to think about taste as purely a matter of individual preference. However, for sociologists, our tastes are not only socially meaningful, they are also socially determined, organized, and constructed. This course will introduce students to the variety of questions sociologists have asked about taste. What is a need? Where do preferences come from? What social functions might our tastes serve? Major theoretical perspectives for answering these questions will be considered, examining the influence of societal institutions, status seeking behaviors, internalized dispositions, and systems of meaning on not only what we enjoy--but what we find most revolting."

They are expected to use them regularly as the trend towards evidence-based decision making continues. Government agencies, foundations, nonprofits, and planning firms all recognize the importance of leveraging data to create effective policy decisions and urban plans. However, planners and urban professionals grapple with how to analyze large and complex datasets. In this class, students will learn about the applied dimensions of the emerging field of urban informatics which is used to understand cities and to inform urban planning practice and policymaking."

        "description": "Sustainability generally refers to the ability of \"systems\" to be maintained such that they remain viable over long periods of time. As much as achieving the perfect sustainable equilibrium may be the ideal, it is important to recognize that there will be competing and conflicting interests, especially within complex hierarchical social, economic and ecological systems, particularly in light of ongoing climatic change. This field intensive course draws on the practices and theories of sustainability and climate change to understand what sustainability can mean in different contexts, and, more important, how nuanced, sustainable solutions can be achieved under varying conditions and in different systems. With an emphasis on the urban environment, the course will consist of projects in which students will identify, analyze, and develop practical proposals to real world issues. This course is intended for a wider audience from a range of disciplines."

Through comparative study of a range of sustainable practices in important subfields of planning, such as transportation, land use, and energy, students will learn about the crucial role cities play in addressing equity and other social concerns, environmental challenges, and global climate change, the constraints and opportunities cities face, and how to effectively address them. Recognizing their increasing importance, the course will focus on the use of data and technology as tools to advance more sustainable land development, travel, energy, natural resources, and other decisions. Finally, particular attention will be given to the practical application of land use planning techniques. The course includes lectures, discussions, case studies, and student presentations."
