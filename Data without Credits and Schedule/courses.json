        "description": "This course introduces students to three perspectives that are fundamental to  their ability to reason with data: critical thinking, inferential thinking, and  computational thinking. Through data modeling and visualization, students will  construct and communicate arguments that are rooted in data. The course expects  only basic computer knowledge and teaches concepts and skills in computer  programming (Python), linear regression, and statistical inference. The course  delves into dilemmas surrounding data analysis, such as balancing individual  privacy and social utility, and prepares students for the data driven world all  around us. Students with interests from politics to sports, finance to journalism,  entrepreneurship to smart cities, etc., can use the knowledge of data science they  gain in this class to enhance those interests. Not to mention a grounding for  students who want to pursue the field of data science itself. Effective Fall 2021, this course fulfills a single unit in each of the following BU Hub areas: Social Inquiry 1, Digital/Multimedia Expression, Research and Information Literacy.\t\t\t  BU Hub   Learn More  Social Inquiry IDigital/Multimedia ExpressionResearch and Information Literacy",

The second half of the course introduces students      to  compiled programming languages, such as Rust, Go and Java, suitable for  building     large projects. Basic data structures  (stacks, queues, priority  queues, binary     search trees), techniques for representing graphs, and basic  graph algorithms      will be explored. Concepts are developed and reinforced  through consideration of     data-driven inquiries in real-world  settings.

Important decisions  impacting criminal justice, housing, finance, labor, healthcare, and education  are frequently determined by or are aided by artificially intelligent  algorithmic technologies that are built and trained on large datasets. The rise  in these technologies presents a challenge for social justice. Though often  presented as neutral decision aids, these technologies often produce harmful  predictions that operate to reinforce old legacies of racial, class, gender, and  heteropatriarchal subordination. Datafication practices, computational  techniques, legal doctrine, and policy play a key role in facilitating these  disparate outcomes. This course will center on the complicated relationship  between social justice and data science. The course will introduce students to  the historical and current role of datafication and computation practices in  social subordination.  Students will leave the course having developed the skill  set needed to identify and critically engage with the social justice challenges  posed by these new technologies."

Biological   research is rarely unequivocal in its findings; students will learn to   systematically identify the claims advanced in research papers and evaluate   whether each claim is established beyond a reasonable doubt by supporting   evidence. We will examine papers that both meet and fail this test. In today's   biology, to properly examine a paper in this way it is increasingly important to   engage with the data provided as supporting evidence, and to critically examine   the computational approach. Students will work with published data and   computational tools. Further, students will learn to identify the ideology   implicit in each paper, to understand how ideology shapes both the research   questions and approach, and to imagine the same research under an alternative   mindset. Classes will be split into lectures on background material for each   paper and group discussions. Students will work in small groups to write a   report on each paper. Each student will work on a final project to produce a   critical review of a broader topic in the field.

This course builds skills in the use of agent-based  modeling using the NetLogo platform as a tool for analyzing complex human- environment problems.  The course will emphasize the iterative model-building  process -- forming research questions, building conceptual and then operational  models, experimenting, and then refining -- to address current research  problems.  Students should expect to commit time outside of meetings to i)  gaining comfort with NetLogo syntax; ii) reading current research in the areas  of agent-based modeling and human environment and health problems; and iii) a  team based approach to building models."

Unlike traditional environments where a company had to build  its own infrastructure often at large time and monetary expense it can now rent  what it needs at the click of a button.  In this course we will provide hands on  experience with one of the large public cloud platforms.  In particular we will  look into the different flavors of compute, storage and networking available,  how best to use them to solve interesting problems, and how to do everything on  a constrained budget.  Students will get accounts and deliver project work on  the public cloud while also learning some of the fundamental principles on how  those different cloud systems work under the covers.  It is recommended that students taking this class have learned the basic  principles of Computer Systems such as those taught in DS210 and/or CS210."

In many cases, it is no longer possible to design feasible    algorithms that can freely access the  entire data set. Instead of that we often    have to resort to techniques that allow for reducing  the amount of data such as    sampling, sketching, dimensionality reduction, and core sets. Apart  from these    approaches, the course will also explore scenarios in which large data sets are     distributed across several machines or even geographical locations and the goal    is to design  efficient communication protocols or MapReduce algorithms. The    course will include a final  project and programming assignments in which we  will   explore the performance of our techniques  when applied to publicly  available   data sets.  \t\t\t  BU Hub   Learn More  Quantitative Reasoning IICreativity/Innovation",

The  dynamic nature of AI systems requires a new set of skills informed by ethics, law, and policy to be  applied throughout the life cycle of such systems: design, development and deployment. It also  involves ongoing collaboration among data scientists, computer scientists, lawyers and ethicists.  Tackling these challenges calls for an interdisciplinary approach: deconstructing these issues by  discipline and reconstructing with an integrated mindset, principles and practices between data  science, ethics and law. This course aims to do so by bringing together students with diverse  disciplinary backgrounds into teams that work together on joint tasks in an intensive series of in- class sessions.

The goal of the course is to  give students exposure to, and practical experience in, formulating data science  questions -- particularly learning how to ask good questions in a specific  domain.  The course will also cover methods of obtaining data and common methods  of processing data from a practical standpoint. It will be organized around a  semester-long group project in which students are organized into teams and  engage with \"clients\" who bring data science questions from a particular domain.    The course will include a formal presentation of results at the end of the  semester."

Before  beginning an external lab rotation, students are expected to develop a plan for  the scope and expected outcomes of the work to be pursued under the supervision  of a named lab rotation advisor. This plan must be pre-approved by the student's  academic, research, or thesis advisor in CDS. While desirable, it is neither  required nor expected that the rotation will result in completion of a  substantial body of work. Lab rotation credits will be noted on the student  transcript as a 4-credit pass/fail independent study course numbered as DS-990."
